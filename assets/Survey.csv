As someone who has that background and vocabulary to describe my experiences, I found a lot of the talks and sessions very unhelpful, since it was mostly people reiterating things that I already knew to be true about that professional landscape. This may be especially helpful for employers, but as a job-seeker, it didn't do much for me. In general, I would like to see more panels targeted towards candidates about SPECIFIC skills and insight regarding job-seeking in the conservation sector, and perhaps matching candidates more specifically with individual organizations/employers who may share their interests other than those on the job list.

A MAJOR problem I had was the fact that during the networking sessions on May 11, most of the organizations that I was interested in connecting with, and that were listed as holding virtual sessions, were not actually present. I would spend 5 minutes ""waiting for the host to start this meeting"" and no one would show up. Out of the 10-ish groups I wanted to connect with, only 2 were available during the networking time slot, and those were already people I was scheduled to interview with the next day.

It would have been helpful to have interviews lined out a little bit more in advance.

The long game really resonates with me. ",Preparing for a More Diverse Workforce and Investing in Your Staff,,,,Somewhat satisfied,,,"I first started out in the on-ramps discussion.  It was not well designed, and the speakers were doing too much off the cuff w/o preparation, or a focus on learning outcomes.  The session I moved too helped me to callibrate where my own organization is within the universe of organizations trying to do this work. Autumn Saxton-Ross has that great ability to go from the detail to the big picture, and I appreciated her practical truthfulness about what supporting staff means.","There was too much ""what do you participants want to learn.""  That's something that should be assessed in advanced, and then the learning in the session is designed around that.  Pulling experts together into a room does not guarantee learning will take place.  It happened that this session had really good communicators in it, and a lot of people who asked interesting questions, but it is not up to the participants to design the learning - that's for the people who are in the session.  Interactive learning work is different thatn having panels that speak out to an audience, and it seemed that wasn't clear to the workshop experts/teachers/guides.  ",Passive,7,Passive,8,"I would say a more conscious turn toward learning design would be helpful.  I am a student of a method called Dialogue Education, a synthesis of learning models developed by Jane Vella, and taught through Global Learning Partners as a very valuable way of looking at this (I am an educator by training).  Learning objectives and methods need to be clearly related to the participants.  More attention to this would super-charge the Bridge Project into being very relevant every step of the way for a wide variety of participants. ",Yes,Somewhat satisfied,Somewhat dissatisfied,Somewhat dissatisfied,Somewhat satisfied,"Equitable Hiring Training with José González,Legal Context of Building Diverse & Inclusive Workplaces with Maia Cogen",Somewhat satisfied,,,Extremely satisfied,I was able to feel where my own organization was in the process of becoming more adept JEDI practitioners.,"The 2nd day was repetitive of the first - just slightly more detail.  I had thought it would actually be related to organizational process, including hiring, like a workshop to improve our JD's, or retention policies that need to be in place.  Again, the learning objectives in my view need to be directly connected to who is attending.  This does take time, but if you have 101 materials for everyone, but somem organizations are at a different place, then the training doesn't feel relevant.  The breakout sessions were done irresponsibly - putting strangers into groups of 7-10 people when they have not had time to build trust and asking them to address complex racial and gender scenarios is unproductive at best.  Saying ""there's no right answer"" does not mean that such a conversation among strangers can simply be unstructured - there's a design fallacy there. There was no direct way to apply any learning or principles from the general discussion in the breakouts, which created negative emotional conditions for people in the midst of something they are asking to learn about. Finally, I am glad that Jose lost the forest background the 2nd day.  The rays from his background evoked a religious motif, and that is not acceptable.  The previous president deliberately manipulated the public with propaganda methods designed to invoke this iconography, and it was counter productive to have that also be present in this context!","Yes, as an employer/hiring partner",,,,,,,Extremely satisfied,Extremely satisfied,Extremely dissatisfied,Neither satisfied nor dissatisfied,,Better,,Yes,"It would be helpful to know in advance what the employers will be responsible for - interview questions, for instance, - and to receive coaching about that.  We had to scramble when we realized that wouldn't be part of any communication.  An overall breakdown of each step of the hiring process at the beginning would have let us schedule time for this important piece.  Also, scheduling 5 interviews in one day was not realistic, nor fair to candidates.  Even with advance notice, there were some times my team could not be available.  That needed to be accounted for in the scheduling.  Instead, our staff had to reach out to reschedule, so that meant wasted work on the Bridge Project side, and scrambling/extra work on our side.  Our ad was also posted as remote, and that change was not made right away.  Some of our candidates applied thinking that the position was remote.  There should be a clearing step before the JD's are posted.  The questions in the application process related to the JD were not clear that they would go onto the web as the JD itself.  While I appreciated that personal characteristics was left off, and learned something there, the job duties were initially left off because the corrleation between the application and what would be posted weren't clear. ",,Meeting and talking with these wonderful candiates!  We really appreciating the sifting and organizing that Bridge Project staff contributed to give us a great candidate pool!,,,,Maryland,Female,White,,"Thank you for all of this work, and for this brave piloting process!  I applaud you for picking up this needed practical piece of JEDI work, and moving it forward.  It was good, and you can make it great!

Last critique thing:  A lot of the panels started with a long round of introductions - 40 minutes on May 11th for the first group!  While this is nice acknowledgement for the people who are giving their time, it is not related to the learning objectives for which you have brought people together.  It felt akin to short advertisements on PBS! :)  This should be more clearly thought through in the future - how do we both appreciate these folks and respect what our audience is here to do!
